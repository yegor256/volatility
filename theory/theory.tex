\title{Volatility of Source Code}

\section{Introduction}

    Volatility of source code is an experimental metric that
    shows how big is the difference between actively and rarely changed (dead)
    code. It is to prove that a big percentage of dead code is
    an indicator of knowledge transfer problems in a project.

\section{Details}

    First, it is observed how often every source code file $F_i$ was changed
    during a lifetime of a project. Consider an example project with 16 files,
    where the most frequently changed file $F_{10}$ was changed nine times
    ($C_{10} = 9$):

    \immediate\write18{php ./observed.php > fig-1.tex}
    \input{fig-1.tex}

    Then, files are numbered and reordered according to their popularity.
    The most popular file $F_{10}$ becomes $F_0$ because $C_{10}$ is
    the maximum, etc.:

    \immediate\write18{php ./ordered.php > fig-2.tex}
    \input{fig-2.tex}

    Then, $F$ and $C$ are translated to $X$ and $p$ numbers in $[0, 1]$ ranges:

    \immediate\write18{php ./normalized.php > fig-3.tex}
    \input{fig-3.tex}

    Then, mean $\mu$ is calculated as:

        $$\mu = \frac{\displaystyle\sum\limits^N_i {X_i \times p_i}}{\displaystyle\sum\limits^N_i p_i}$$

    Finally, variance is calculated as:

        $$Var(X) = \frac{\displaystyle\sum\limits {(X_i - \mu)^2 \times p_i}}{\displaystyle\sum\limits p_i}$$

    For the example above the numbers are:

    \immediate\write18{php ./numbers.php > fig-4.tex}
    \input{fig-4.tex}

    Variance $Var(X)$ is called ``source code volatility''.

\section{Alternatives}

    Similar calculations can be done:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item with lines of code instead of files;
        \item with unique file editors instead of file changes.
    \end{itemize}

\end{document}
